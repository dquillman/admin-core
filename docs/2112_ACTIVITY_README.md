# How to Observe 2112

The **2112 Activity** panel provides a transparent, read-only view into the autonomous decisions and health monitoring performed by the 2112 agent system.

## Accessing the Panel

1. Log in to **Admin Core**.
2. Navigate to **2112 Activity** in the sidebar.

## Activity Sections

### 1. Recent Decisions

Displays a real-time feed of decisions made by 2112.

- **Blue**: Standard operational decisions (Resource Allocation, Feature Prioritization).
- **Emerald**: Implemented decisions.
- **Amber**: Simulations (Test Mode).
- **Entries show**: Confidence score, reasoning summary, and recommended action.

### 2. App Health Changes

Monitors the state of connected applications.

- **Health State**: OK, Warning, Critical.
- **Silence Warnings**: Automatically flagged if an app has not emitted an event in >3 days.

### 3. Founder Briefing

Shows the latest periodic summary generated by 2112 for the founder, covering key metrics and strategic shifts.

### 4. Observed Live Signals

Displays verified, real-time metrics aggregated safely from production.

- **Weekly Active Learners**: Count of users active in the last 7 days who have engaged with the AI Tutor.
- **Intent**: Used to gauge engagement health patterns.
- **Guardrails**: Aggregated count only. No user identifiers exposed.

## ⚠️ How to Use Simulation Safely

The **Simulation Panel** allows admins to trigger synthetic decision cycles to verify system responsiveness.

### Rules of Engagement

- **TEST MODE ONLY**: Data is written to a dedicated `simulations` collection.
- **Strict Isolation**: 2112 Simulation never touches the production `decisions` log or modifies `settings`/`users`.
- **Status Flag**: All verified simulated decisions are marked with status `simulated` in the UI.
- **No Impact**: Simulations do NOT trigger actual resource changes, notifications, or external API calls.

### Steps to Run a Simulation

1. Ensure you are logged in as an Admin.
2. Locate the "2112 Simulation (Test Mode)" panel on the right.
3. Select a **Target App**.
4. Select a **Scenario** (e.g., "Silent App Alert").
5. Click **Simulate Decision**.
6. Verify the new entry appears in the "Recent Decisions" feed with an **AMBER** indicator.

## Core Architecture Principles

### What 2112 IS

- A read-only intelligence layer.
- A signal aggregator (trends, counts, deltas).
- A recommender system ("Signal suggests...").

### What 2112 is NOT

- An execution engine.
- A deployment automator.
- A replacement for human approval.
- **2112 does not execute, modify, or deploy.**

## Future Phases

- **Phase 1 (Current)**: Observability & Simulation (Read-Only).
- **Phase 2**: Opportunity Detection (Read-Only analysis of revenue leaks).
- **Phase 3**: Revenue Experiments (Human-approved A/B test suggestions).

- **Phase 3**: Revenue Experiments (Human-approved A/B test suggestions).
