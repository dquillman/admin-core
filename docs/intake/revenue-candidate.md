# Revenue Candidate Intake

## 1. Purpose

This intake exists to:

* **Protect time:** Your scarcest resource is not code, but attention.
* **Focus on monetizable work:** The Factory builds assets, not toys.
* **Prevent factory misuse:** Stop interesting but unprofitable ideas at the gate.

## 2. Candidate Snapshot

* **App / Feature Name:** ____________________
* **Target User:** ____________________
* **Pain Being Solved:** ____________________
* **Current Solution:** (How are they currently paying to solve this, or paying in time/pain to avoid it?)

## 3. Revenue Hypothesis

* **Who pays?** (User, Business, Advertiser?)
* **What do they pay for?** (Time saved, Access, status, Compliance?)
* **Why now?** (What changed in the world/market?)
* **What replaces this if it fails?** (Backup plan/pivot?)

## 4. Build Effort Check

* **UI-only possible?** [Yes / No]
* **Uses Admin Core?** [ ] Issues [ ] Broadcast [ ] Roles
* **Requires infra changes?** [Yes / No] -> (If Yes, **STOP**. This is likely too expensive for an MVP).

## 5. Go / No-Go Rules

**GO Conditions:**

* [ ] Clear payer identified.
* [ ] Pain is acute/expensive.
* [ ] Build effort is low (likely UI-only).

**NO-GO Conditions:**

* [ ] "User buildup strategy" (monetize later).
* [ ] Requires massive infra/data sync.
* [ ] Solves a mild inconvenience, not a pain.

## 6. Ledger Integration

* Only **GO** items proceed to the [App Kickoff Template](../templates/app-kickoff.md).
* Only **GO** items are logged in the [Factory Output Ledger](../factory-output-ledger.md).
* **NO-GO** items are successes of filtration, not failures of execution. Park them, don't build them.
