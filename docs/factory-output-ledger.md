# Factory Output Ledger

## 1. Purpose

The Factory Output Ledger exists to:

* **Track real output:** Create a tangible record of what the Admin Core App Factory produces.
* **Prevent the "I didn't do anything today" lie:** Combat the feeling of stagnation even when valuable work was done.
* **Measure factory effectiveness over time:** Provide historical proof of progress.

## 2. What Counts as Output

An acceptable entry is any concrete unit of value, including:

* **Shipped UI Change:** A visible improvement to the interface.
* **New Admin Core Capability:** A new tool for the operator (e.g., Broadcast Messaging).
* **Documented Policy or Playbook:** A new rule or guide that standardizes operations.
* **Pipeline Improvement:** Standardization checks or safety guardrails.
* **Risk Reduction Artifact:** Docs that prevent future failures.

**Note:** Documentation counts as First-Class Output in this factory.

## 3. Ledger Format

Record output using this simple block format:

### [Date]

* **Output Name:** [Name]
* **Type:** [UI / Doc / Policy / Fix / Capability]
* **Time Spent:** [Duration]
* **Notes:** [Brief context]

### Example Entry

### 2026-01-23

* **Output Name:** Factory Output Ledger
* **Type:** Policy
* **Time Spent:** 5 mins
* **Notes:** Created the system to track future outputs.

## 4. Daily Usage Rule

* **Frequency:** At most one entry per day (unless it was a highly productive multi-task day).
* **Timing:** Create the entry at the close of the Daily Operator Loop.
* **No Backfilling:** Do not attempt to reconstruct history from weeks ago. Use it forward-looking only.

## 5. What This Is NOT

* **Not a To-Do List:** This is for what is *done*, not what is *planned*.
* **Not a Backlog:** Do not dump ideas here.
* **Not a Productivity Score:** High volume of entries does not equal high value.
* **Not a Performance Metric:** This is for the Operator's peace of mind, not external judgment.
